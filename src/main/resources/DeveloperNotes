Current Todo:

Class "Upgrades", stat shards or whatnot. Need to make skilltree nodes accept upgrades and function off unlocked variable?
Or function off just checking list of unlocked upgrades

Swapping Classes change level / stats
SkillTree different classes

Skills
no damage ticks important for skill damage

- Make new classes for new types of abilities, ie toggle
- Not all skills are castable. Some are passives. Design smartly (you dont need many castables to have a fun class)

General
- Sound design very important (ie book flipping noise when GUI pages, or playing noise when mobs spawn in dungeon thematically)
