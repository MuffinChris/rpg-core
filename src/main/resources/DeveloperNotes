Current Todo:

PassiveSkill

Swapping Classes change level / stats
SkillTree different classes

Skills
no damage ticks important for skill damage

- Make new classes for new types of abilities, ie toggle
- Not all skills are castable. Some are passives. Design smartly (you dont need many castables to have a fun class)

GUI
- Save to database last inventory just incase

General
- Sound design very important (ie book flipping noise when GUI pages, or playing noise when mobs spawn in dungeon thematically)
