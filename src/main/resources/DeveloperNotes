Current Todo:
Swapping Classes change level / stats

SkillTree connections as actual objects.
Not all unlockables are Skills. Refactor by making SkillTree entry with slot and corresponding connections. Graph

Skills
no damage ticks important for skill damage

- Make new classes for new types of abilities, ie toggle
- Cast the abilities from some other casting manager. has more flexibility (same as old system)
- Not all skills are castable. Some are passives. Design smartly (you dont need many castables to have a fun class)

General
- Sound design very important (ie book flipping noise when GUI pages, or playing noise when mobs spawn in dungeon thematically)
