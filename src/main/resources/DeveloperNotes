Current Todo:
Skills

Skills
- Make new classes for new types of abilities, ie toggle
- Cast the abilities from some other casting manager. has more flexibility (same as old system)
- Not all skills are castable. Some are passives. Design smartly (you dont need many castables to have a fun class)

General
- Sound design very important (ie book flipping noise when GUI pages, or playing noise when mobs spawn in dungeon thematically)
