Current Todo:

Damage!


Classes
Need to be able to swap / reset. Will be implemented with database
Class info / stats command? (also picker. no class class. perhaps handle logic by being null)

Skills
no damage ticks important for skill damage

- Make new classes for new types of abilities, ie toggle
- Not all skills are castable. Some are passives. Design smartly (you dont need many castables to have a fun class)

GUI
- Save to database last inventory just incase

General
- Sound design very important (ie book flipping noise when GUI pages, or playing noise when mobs spawn in dungeon thematically)
